# Project
3rd year MPHYS project on magnetic field of Ganymede

/data folder contains all magnetometer data downloaded from the PDS

/code folder contains the self written code to plot figures relevant to the aims and objectives of the research project undertaken in year 3 of MPHYs:

Aim:
The main aim of the project is to understand the unique Magnetic Environment of Ganymede and its interaction with Jupiter's Magnetosphere. 

Objectives:
1.	Isolate the Magnetic Field of Ganymede from Jupiter’s Magnetic Field through data analysis and modelling techniques of the field components and magnitude.
2.	Determine the characteristics of Ganymede’s Magnetic Field for the varying mission flyby conditions to obtain information on its spatial distribution and evolution over time.
3.	Investigate the dynamics of the interaction between Ganymede's Magnetic Field, when transversing through different regions of Jupiter’s Magnetospheric Plasma Sheet.
